# Brain_tumor-Classification using Deep Learning


This project implements a deep learning model to classify Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of human brains into four distinct categories:

Glioma

Meningioma

Pituitary Tumor

No Tumor

The model uses transfer learning with the VGG16 architecture and achieves an accuracy of 95% on the test dataset.
